Repo created programmatically. Project Title: Yet another Kafka (YaK)
This project began with using socket socket programming that gives server client connnections.
So clients were split into producers and consumers.
And server was the broker.
Then multiple brokers were made to handle failure.
And zookeeper checked the presence of leader and worker.
